Hello! My name is Jo√£o Robson. I am a Software Engineering student from Brazil interested in Machine Learning.

The goal of this blog is to explain concepts involving A.I. and data science clearly and intuitively, addressing the details behind the techniques and models used and providing help mainly to those beginning in the area.

As far as possible, I will try to utilize and reference different types of study materials (videos, images, charts, etc.) to facilitate the understanding of abstract ideas and to satisfy different learning styles.

Occasionally, I will write about stuff that I like (sports, books, movies, science or music) that might not be related to artificial intelligence. Even so, you could give it a read and tell me your opinion. :) My email is joaorobsonmartins@gmail.com.

If you are interested to take a look at what I have coded, visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/joaorobson).

Feel free to check my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joaorobson/) too.
